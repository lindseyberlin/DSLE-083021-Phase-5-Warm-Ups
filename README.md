# DSLE-083021 - Phase 5 Warm Up Prompts!

Small notebooks to practice Python and SQL problems during our optional Phase 5 Warm Ups!

Please fork this notebook to work through it! Then you can either add this original repository as a new remote (not origin) on your local, or can use the 'Fetch Upstream' button on your fork to collect new changes as I add new notebooks.

4. You can make changes to the notebooks now! Remember to push your changes to your forked version of the repo (to save your local changes to your online version):
